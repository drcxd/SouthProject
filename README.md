# SouthProject

This is a prototype for a visual novel game engine. At least this is
what I intended to do.

It is developed upon SDL2.

The project is developed during my junior year as an attempt to learn
programming and developing game. The framework of the project was
mainly learned from \[1\].

The repository is messy. I was not familiar with the convention how a
program should be organized. So I almost put everything together,
source code, library, image, music, script and save files.

This project is developed using Microsoft Visual Studio and could be
compiled and run using any version later than 2015. However, you need
to set up the library of SDL2 yourself.

Detailed documentation is in `Documentation` directory.

# 南方Project

这是一个视觉小说游戏引擎的原型。至少这是我曾经想做的东西。

它依赖于SDL2。

该项目是我在大学期间的最后一年开发的，作为一个学习编程与开发游戏的尝试。
代码的框架主要借鉴自[1]。

这个代码库很混乱。我当初对于如何组织程序代码毫无了解，所以我把几乎所有
东西都放到一起，源代码，库，图片，音乐，脚本以及存档文件。

该项目是用微软的Visual Studio开发的并且可以用2015之后的任何一个版本编
译并运行。但是你必须自己把SDL2的库配置好。

详细的文档在`Directory`目录下。
